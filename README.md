## Overview

**Interchainnft-options** is a fork of the Hook Protocol, tailored for Cosmos-based blockchains and is built using the Cosmwasm smart contract framework, ensuring compatibility with Cosmos-based blockchains.
Hook Protocol is an oracle-free, on-chain option protocol designed for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Unlike many existing approaches to NFT DeFi, Hook preserves the non-fungible nature of NFTs, eliminating the need to convert them into fungible tokens.
